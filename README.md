# Simple App that uses Component based components

This is an app that uses only react (no 3rd party state management like Redux or built-in context api) since this is a very simple one.

The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with building components using classes instead of functional components and using hooks.

You view the my code on github & test it out online here: https://projekt2501-monster-rolodex.netlify.app/
